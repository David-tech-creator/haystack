## Mission

Join a fast-growing applied AI startup to ship retrieval-augmented generation features across enterprise workflows. You will own the model pipeline end to end and partner with product to ship high-signal experiments weekly.

## Outcomes

- Lead iterative fine-tuning cycles across proprietary datasets and open-source checkpoints.
- Implement evaluation harnesses covering hallucination, latency, cost, and safety metrics.
- Collaborate with platform engineers on scalable vector and feature stores.
- Mentor two mid-level ML engineers and partner with product to prioritize the roadmap.

## What success looks like

Within the first 90 days you will have launched at least one net-new AI-powered feature, established clear evaluation metrics, and documented a repeatable experimentation workflow the wider team can adopt.
