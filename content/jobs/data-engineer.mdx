## Mission

Own the data platform powering real-time analytics for a Series C marketplace. You will design batch and streaming systems that give operators and data scientists clean, reliable signal.

## Outcomes

- Architect the next-generation Lakehouse with column-level lineage and governance baked in.
- Productionize streaming pipelines (Kafka + Flink) to reduce latency from hours to minutes.
- Partner with analytics engineers on semantic models and experimentation frameworks.
- Establish platform reliability KPIs and runbooks.

## What success looks like

In six months the new pipelines support sub-5 minute data freshness, BI teams ship features confidently, and the organization trusts the data platform as a strategic asset.
