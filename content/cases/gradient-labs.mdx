### Context

Gradient Labs needed a staff-level ML engineer to unlock enterprise integrations. Previous searches had stalled with noisy pipelines and slow feedback loops.

### Approach

We launched a two-stage sprint: calibration interviews with the founding team, followed by a structured signal report covering technical depth, product intuition, and collaboration markers.

### Outcome

Within 21 days the team extended an offer to a staff ML engineer with experience shipping multi-tenant models. The candidate accepted within 72 hours, citing the clarity of the process and work samples as the biggest differentiator.
