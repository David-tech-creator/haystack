### Context

NovaOps builds developer tooling for production AI teams. They needed two applied scientists with research depth and shipping experience, yet internal interview capacity was constrained.

### Approach

We created asynchronous work samples mirroring NovaOpsâ€™ ranking challenges. Weekly signal reports aligned leadership while we handled candidate communication and scheduling.

### Outcome

Two applied scientists signed offers within 30 days, both bringing complementary skill sets. NovaOps maintained focus on product delivery while keeping hiring velocity high.
