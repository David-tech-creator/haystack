### Context

Orbit Data’s founders needed a senior analytics lead to mature experimentation and reporting. The existing talent pipeline lacked enterprise-scale experience.

### Approach

Haystack introduced a scorecard focused on experimentation velocity, stakeholder management, and hands-on SQL fluency. Candidates completed a contextual work sample grounded in Orbit’s metrics.

### Outcome

A vetted shortlist surfaced within five days and the founders made an offer after only three interviews. The new analytics lead shipped the first end-to-end experiment framework within the first month.
